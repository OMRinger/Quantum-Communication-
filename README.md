# Quantum-Communication-
The Quantum Communication Project leverages quantum entanglement to simulate secure and efficient data transmission, comparing it with classical systems. It includes QKD simulations, performance analysis tools, and hybrid protocols for integrating quantum and classical communications, aiming to advance secure global communication technologies.
