# Quantum Communication Project

## Overview
This project explores the potential of quantum communication, leveraging quantum entanglement for secure and efficient data transmission. It aims to simulate quantum communication systems, analyze their performance, and compare them with classical communication systems.

## Features
- Simulation of quantum key distribution (QKD) using entangled qubits.
- Analysis tools for evaluating efficiency, security, and speed of quantum communication.
- Hybrid protocol implementation for integrating quantum systems with classical communication infrastructures.

## Getting Started
1. Install necessary Python packages, including Qiskit for quantum simulations.
2. Run the example scripts in the `examples/` directory to see the simulation in action.
3. Explore the `quantum_comm/` package to understand the simulation and analysis processes.

## Development
This project is open-source and welcomes contributions. Whether you're interested in enhancing the simulation capabilities, expanding the analysis tools, or improving the documentation, your contributions are valuable.
